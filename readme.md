### Instructions to run the project
If you just want to run the project and don't want to play with the code, follow these steps -
- Step 1 : Click Enigma.exe from the repo, click download on the next page
- Step 2 : Do the same for helpfile.txt and muneng.gif
- Step 3 : After they have all been downloaded to the same folder, browse to the folder and run Enigma.exe
- Step 4 : Wait for the program to start. Click help after it starts or watch the youtube demo to learn how to use it. (The video is highly recommended watching).

If you want to modify the code, download git and clone this repo to your computer (you can find how to do that easily with google).

### File-list
- AlphaVers is the very elementary design of the backend of an Enigma machine
- BetaVers is the fully functional backend of the same complete with lots of print messages showing the internal workings of the machine and an Arduiuno and password encryption mode
- Enigma GUI is the elementary tkinter GUI design for the project
- FinalVers is the fully functional merge of the backend and frontend
- Enigma.rar gives a working .exe file (made using FinalVers) to directly run through the GUI and runs super quick
- FastFinalVers is the FinalVers minus the print statements so it runs much quicker inside Thonny
