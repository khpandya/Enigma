AlphaVers is the very elementary design of the backend of an Enigma machine
BetaVers is the fully functional backend of the same complete with lots of 
print messages showing the internal workings of the machine and an Arduiuno 
and password encryption mode

Enigma GUI is the elementary tkinter GUI design for the project
FinalVers is the fully functional merge of the backend and frontend
Enigma.rar gives a working .exe file (made using FinalVers) to directly 
run through the GUI and runs super quick
FastFinalVers is the FinalVers minus the print statements so it runs much 
quicker inside Thonny
